 <dl><h2>Albums</h2>
 <dt>Try!</dt>
 <dd>The one and only album, Try!, was released November 22, 2005. It's a hard-hitting blues-rock fusion that brings the magic of old school blues trios into the 21st century. It's hit single, Who Did You Think I Was, peaked in the charts at no. 92. Notable features of the album that found themselves on John Mayer's solo album Continuum are Gravity and Vultures. 5/5 Would recommend.</dd>
<dt>Where The Light Is</dt>
<dd>Where The Light Is stands as the John Mayer Live Concert. Recorded December 8, 2007 at the Nokia Theater at L.A. Live in Los Angeles, California, the dvd concert serves as a major milestone for Mayer's music, guitar playing, and stardom. The concert had 3 sets: a solo acoustic set, a John Mayer Trio set, and a full band set. The Trio played much of its own discography and other great songs like Everyday I Have the Blues, Out of My Mind and Bold as Love. Gold Star would recommend.</dl>
